## Hyperthyroidism Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Classifiers
This project aims to develop a predictive model for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in patients using
machine learning techniques. We will utilize a dataset containing various features related to
thyroid function tests, symptoms, and medical history to train and evaluate several classifiers.
The study will focus on comparing the performance of classifiers such as Multinomial Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to
determine the most effective model for accurate hyperthyroidism prediction. The project's
ultimate goal is to contribute to improved medical diagnostics and decision-making in the field of
thyroid disorders
